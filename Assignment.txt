🔍 Assignment: Build a Simple AI Agent 
🧠 Objective:
To assess your curiosity, learning agility, and problem-solving approach, not just your technical skills.
Even if you’re new to coding or AI, this is your chance to show how you think, explore, and work with AI tools like ChatGPT to build something meaningful.
📦 What You’ll Build:
Design a simple AI Agent (like a chatbot or a task assistant) using the 4-step architecture model. You don’t need to code everything perfectly. Instead, show how far you can go by:
Asking the right questions
Iterating on prompts
Learning through ChatGPT

 📋 Reference Here


🛠️ Your Task:
Choose a Use Case:
 Pick a simple problem that an AI Agent can help with.
 Example:


“AI Agent to suggest daily writing prompts for bloggers.”
“AI Agent to help students revise for an exam.”



Design the 4 Layers of Prompts:
 For your use case, create prompts for:


Input Understanding (What is the user asking?)
State Tracker (What context/state is remembered?)
Task Planner (What steps does the agent take?)
Output Generator (How does it respond clearly?)


💡 Use the reference documents to guide you. You can modify the prompts or create your own.


Iterate & Build with ChatGPT:
Use your prompts inside ChatGPT.
Ask follow-up questions if the output is not as expected.
Keep improving your prompts and logic step-by-step.


Submit an Approach Document:
 This is the most important part.

 Your document should include:
Your chosen use case.
Prompts for each of the 4 steps.
Snapshots or text logs of your ChatGPT interactions.
What you learned, where you got stuck, and how you overcame it.
Any code samples or system messages if generated.


📌 Think of this as a journal of your journey with ChatGPT.











📤 AI Agent Assignment – Submission Format
Note: This document is both your journal and artifact of thought. We’re evaluating how you think, build, and debug, not just what you build.

Name:
AI Agent Title / Use Case: (e.g., AI Agent to help college students generate daily journaling prompts)
🧠 SECTION 2: PROBLEM FRAMING
1.1. What problem does your AI Agent solve?
 (Write 2-3 lines to describe the user problem and context)
1.2. Why is this agent useful?
 (Describe the core value delivered to the user)
1.3. Who is the target user?
 (Be specific — “college student revising for an exam”, “freelance writer”, etc.)
1.4. What not to include?
 (Optional, but useful. Mention features you consciously avoided for scope discipline)
🧱 SECTION 3: 4-LAYER PROMPT DESIGN
Create a subsection for each of the 4 components of the agent architecture:
🔹 3.1 INPUT UNDERSTANDING

What is this prompt responsible for? (1-2 lines)
Example Input + Output: (Optional if tested)
🔹 3.2 STATE TRACKER
Prompt:
How does this help the agent “remember”?
Did you simulate memory with variables / system messages? If yes, how?

Prompt:
What steps does your agent take internally to solve the problem?
Did you use chaining? Branching? How did you manage complexity?

3.4 OUTPUT GENERATOR
Prompt:
What kind of output formatting or phrasing did you aim for?
Any special behavior? (e.g., examples, markdown formatting, tone control, etc.)

Rubric for Evaluation (Work Simulation Style)
Dimension
Weight
What Good Looks Like
Red Flags
Problem Framing
20%
Clear, original use-case. Well-scoped agent behavior. Avoided vagueness. Shows user-centric thinking.
Chose a generic or unclear use-case (e.g. “make a chatbot”). Vague problem statement.
Prompt Architecture Quality
25%
Each of the 4 prompts reflects different system responsibilities. Prompts are concise, modular, and testable. Shows understanding of functional decomposition.
Prompts overlap in function, are too verbose, or fail to create modular behavior.
Exploration Quality (AI Collaboration)
20%
Good trail of follow-up questions and prompt debugging. Attempts multiple iterations. Shows ability to collaborate with ChatGPT like a teammate.
One-shot prompts. No iteration. No recovery from errors. No exploration of alternatives.
Output Clarity & Functional Coverage
15%
The generated outputs (agent responses or flow) demonstrate useful behavior. Shows command of output formatting, response variation, or state transitions.
The output is trivial, repetitive, or structurally broken.
Documentation of Process (Approach Doc)
15%
Thoughtfully documents the journey. Annotates prompts with rationale. Reflects on what worked and what didn’t. Data trail is clean.
Only dumps the final result. No iterative record. No reflection or analysis.
Initiative / Hack Value
5%
Goes beyond base instructions — e.g. added context memory, simulated user inputs, nested workflows, or tried to test edge cases.
Minimum viable effort with no signs of initiative.

🕒 Time Estimate:
8-10 hours, depending on how deep you explore.

💡 Tips for Applicants
These should be shared as part of the brief to guide execution:
🧠 Think Like an Agent Architect
Your job isn’t just to “make a chatbot” — you are defining how an agent breaks down a user’s request into logical steps.
Try to separate “understanding”, “thinking”, and “responding” like different departments in a company.
💬 Ask Better Questions
If ChatGPT doesn’t give what you want, don’t settle. Ask:
“How can I make this output more modular?”
“What if the user gives a bad input?”
“How do I retain memory across turns?”


Your ability to ask follow-up questions shows whether you’re teachable and resilient.
📐 Design with Clarity
Good prompts are like good APIs — each does one job and can be reused.
Don’t hardcode outcomes. Let the prompt guide structure, not content.
🧪 Debug Like a Researcher
When things go wrong, don’t delete and restart. Tweak. Test. Compare.
Log what changed and why. We want to see your diagnostic thought process.
📓 Document Like an Engineer
Think of your approach doc as a hand-off artifact — someone else should be able to reuse or build on your logic.
Annotate your prompts: “This prompt ensures the agent understands ambiguous user questions by…”
Don’t be afraid to admit where you got stuck. We value truth over polish.

💡 Final Tips for First-Time Explorers
Tip
Why It Matters
❓ If confused, ask ChatGPT itself what a prompt should do.
It can teach you how to work with it if you treat it like a teammate.
🪜 Build prompt logic step by step.
Don’t try to write perfect prompts from the start. Work like a scientist.
📝 Keep a scratchpad next to you.
Helps track how your thinking evolved. Makes documentation easier later.
🚫 Don’t try to “complete the assignment” fast.
This is a simulation of how DeepThought works. Curiosity > speed.
🔍 Use analogies to understand prompts.
Think of each prompt like a department in a company — each doing its job.
